## Content of the repository
This repository is mainly realized following the path of the [Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis](https://en.didattica.unipd.it/off/2021/LM/SC/SC2443/000ZZ/SCP8082557/N0) course and contains my solutions of the exercises assigned by Professor Alberto Garfagnini. 

All projects are carried out in [R](https://www.r-project.org/). 

## Folders
Each folder contains the instructions for the exercises provided by the Professor, and the solutions, both in `Rmd` and `html` format.
